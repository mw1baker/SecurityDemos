== Lab 4: Implementing DevSecOps to Build and Automate Security into the Application using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security

=== Lab Objective

The goal of this lab is to learn how to build a secure software factory that orchestrates a combination of different security tools. With the advent of DevSecOps, security is put front and center - it is addressed in terms of people, processes, and technology. Security tools are integrated right into the build process and we could easily break the build if security requirements are not met with the security gates that we build into the CI/CD pipeline.

=== Introduction

The benefits of DevOps and Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) have been demonstrated with great success over the years. Organizations have always sought to do more with less. Security was treated as an add-on to the end of the software delivery process in many cases, and it often delayed software delivery. The industry recognized that this had to change. Organizations must continue to meet contractual and regulatory obligations as well as internal security standards, but need to accelerate software delivery to capitalize on opportunities. To enable organizations to meet these standards and deliver at the speed of DevOps security has faced the choice of becoming irrelevant or molding to modern software delivery practices. Security is critical to deliver software quickly and has become a metric of software quality, so there was a push to include “Sec” in “DevOps.” With the advent of DevSecOps, Shift Left is a practice intended to find and prevent defects early in the software delivery process. Security tools are integrated directly into the build process. As a result, the CI/CD process can move faster and reduce the length of time to delivery while still continuously improving the quality of each release. +
This lab exercise will focus on some of the technologies used to implement automated security compliance controls within a typical CI/CD application pipeline. +
A number of tools have been installed and pre-configured to support the DevSecOps pipeline. Most of these tools are running containerized within the Red Hat OpenShift cluster. Here is the pipeline we will be stepping through during our lab:

=== Lab 4.1 Continuous Integration

This first module will run an OpenShift Pipeline and let us explore the steps in a sample secure pipeline. +
In this lab, we will learn how to start the Tekton pipeline and how to use the tasks to integrate the security and gitops tools within the development lifecycle.

. There are three ways to start the pipeline:
** Option 1: Use Developer UI to start
.. Browse to the OpenShift Console URL in the browser
.. Log in to the console using the provided credentials
.. If we are not already in the Developer Perspective, select Developer to switch to the developer console in the top left corner.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops04.png[200,200]
+
.. Navigate to the “ocp-workshop” project
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops05.png[200,200]
+
.. Click 'Pipelines' on the left menu to view all pipelines
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops06.png[400,700]
+
.. Click onto the “petclinic-build-dev” pipeline
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops07.png[600,800]
+
.. From the top right corner, click “Actions” → select “start”
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops08.png[200,700]
+
.. Under “Workspaces”, select PVC and then choose the PVC petclinic-build-workspace as the shared storage path that the pipelines will use at runtime.
.. Under “maven-settings” select Config Map and choose “maven-settings” as the Config Map
.. Click start
+
** Option 2: Command-line to start the pipeline
The command-line is a convenient way to start the pipeline while testing, and it is a way to simulate a PR or push to git and trigger the pipeline. It is for users who prefer the CLI to start the pipeline.
+
.. Run:
+
[source]

|===
|oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatDemos/SecurityDemos/master/2021Labs/OpenShiftSecurity/documentation/labs-artifacts/pipeline-build-dev-run.yaml -n ocp-workshop

|===
+
** Option 3: When new code is pushed to the git repo, it will also trigger the pipeline to start. In this lab, git repo is Gogs. The steps below are for pushing code via the “Gogs” git repo.
This option may be the most popular from a developer perspective. The pipeline starts from a PR or a push into the git repo and the webhook automatically starts the pipeline.
+
.. From the dev console, click `Search` on the left nav menu.
.. Type 'route' and click `Route` from the list.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops09.png[400,400]
+
.. Click the `Gogs` route to open the gogs URL:
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops10.png[400,600]
+
.. Click on the `Sign In`, to log in with the _gogsadmin_ credentials:
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops11.png[500,400]
+
|===
|User: gogsadmin
|Password: openshift
|===
+
.. Select the spring-petclinic repository inside of the gogsadmin account:
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops12.png[400,700]
+
.. Click into the README.md, click in `Edit this file` and introduce a change:
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops13.png[400,700]
+
.. Commit the change that we introduced into the README.md:
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops14.png[400,700]
+
[Note] This is only for demo purposes. Usually, the push to master is not recommended, and it’s a Pull Request / Merge Request from another branch (such as develop) that is used instead.
+
.. The pipeline will be triggered automatically, please skip to step 6 of this lab to see the Pipeline Runs console.
+
. Open the browser using the provided OpenShift console URL.
. Log in to the console using the provided credential.
. Click to `Developer` to switch to the developer console.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops04.png[200,200]
+
. Make sure the `ocp-workshop` project is selected.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops15.png[300,300]
+
. Click `Pipelines` on the left menu to view all pipelines.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops16.png[400,700]
+
. Click onto Pipeline `petclinic-build-dev` and click onto the `Pipeline Runs` tab.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops17.png[400,700]
+
.  Click onto the Pipeline Run.
+
Please see the Pipeline Run as shown below when it starts.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops18.png[500,700]
+
The pipeline run will fail at step “image-check” in the pipeline run. This is due to an important severity vulnerability in the image being caught by a pipeline gate policy, stopping the deployment.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops20.png[500,700]
+
The vulnerability has to be fixed for the pipeline to complete successfully. We will do it in the next module. Here is what a successful run looks like.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops19.png[500,700]
+
The next module, lab 4.2 will walk through what’s happened and how to resolve it securely.
+
[Note] In addition to triggering a pipeline run manually, every push to the spring-petclinic git repository on the Gogs git server executes the pipeline.
. Explore the pipeline! Once the pipeline is started, we can click on each detailed step to explore logs for each step. We’ll direct some of the explorations in the next few steps.
.. *Source Clone* - app source code is pulled from the Git (Gogs) server installed in this lab.
+
[Note] Files persist between steps in the pipeline via workspace that is pre-defined in the pipeline.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops24.png[400,700]
+
... Copy the git repo URL. Open a browser tab to explore the code
... The URL takes us to the Gogs git repo as shown below.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops25.png[600,700]
+
... Click onto `gogsadmin` and there are 2 repositories for this lab.
+
The credentials of gogsadmin user are:
+
|===
|User: gogsadmin
|Pass: openshift
|===
+
.. *Dependency Report* is a step in the pipeline that creates a report of the app dependencies from the source code and uploads it to the report server repository.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops26.png[300,700]
+
Let’s look at the report!
+
... From the dev console, click `Search` on the left nav menu
... Click Resources, type `route`, and click `Route` from the list
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops09.png[400,400]
+
... Click on the reports repo link
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops27.png[300,700]
+
... Click onto the `petclinic-build` link from the page
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops28.png[300,500]
+
... Continue to click on spring-petclinic → target → site
... Click on the `Dependencies` from the page. We may examine the details from that page by scrolling down
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops29.png[300,700]
+
.. *Unit tests* task is executed in parallel with dependency report.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops30.png[300,700]
+
. *Release-app* is where** **the application is packaged as a JAR and released to the Sonatype Nexus snapshot repository.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops31.png[300,700]
+
. *Build-image* step is when a container image is built in DEV environment using S2I, pushed to OpenShift internal registry, and tagged with spring-petclinic:[branch]-[commit-sha] and spring-petclinic:latest

=== Lab 4.2 DevSecOps steps using Advanced Cluster Security

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (ACS) for Kubernetes controls clusters and applications from a single console, with built-in security policies. +
First-generation container security platforms focus on the container. ACS’s focus on Kubernetes helps DevOps and Security teams operationalize security, with a Kubernetes-native architecture that leverages Kube's declarative data and built-in controls for richer context, native enforcement, and continuous hardening. In addition, ACS focuses on Kubernetes helps DevOps and Security teams operationalize security, simplifying the process of protecting the cloud-native application stack.

In this lab, we will learn how ACS integrates into the CI/CD process. ACS not only simplifies the process but provides visibility to the security team in our organization.
Using https://docs.openshift.com/acs/cli/getting-started-cli.html[roxctl] and ACS API, we integrated several additional security steps into our DevSecOps pipeline:

. The *image scan* step uses the ACS Scanner to scan the image generated and pushed in the last step.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops33.png[300,700]
+
In the logs of this step, there is a direct link to the image scan in ACS.
+
[Note] If we see a security certificate warning proceeding to that link, ignore it. +
Copy and paste it into another tab in order to get more information about the scanned image. Enter the following information:
+
|===
|User: admin
|Pass: stackrox
|===
+
The URL takes us to Vulnerability Management. Here is an overview of the vulnerabilities (CVEs) included in this image.
+
.. Under the Deployment tab
The ACS tool is aware of if this image is deployed. Since the first pipeline didn’t pass all of its gates, at first there will be no deployments displayed.

.. Under the Component tab
This is a view of all of the components in this image. It lists relevant information, such as the number of CVEs that can be fixed with an upgrade of the component, top CVSS score associated with any of the CVEs in the component, and other deployments that include each component.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops34.png[500,700]
+
For example, if we click on the tomcat 9.0.31 component, we will see the details of the component as shown below. This page shows the risk priority, the CVE's information, the location of the component, and the version of the component to upgrade to in order to remediate the CVE.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops35.png[500,700]
+
.. Click “X” on the top right to go back
.. CVEs tab presents a view of all vulnerabilities of the image
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops36.png[500,700]
+
.. Go back to the Overview, and scroll down to the `Image findings` section, we will see the fixable CVEs. These are CVEs where ACS knows there are fixes available.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops37.png[300,700]
+
.. In the ‘Dockerfile’ tab of the ‘Image Findings’ section, the detailed image components and related CVEs are shown per each step, per the ACS CVE database.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops38.png[400,700]
+
Feel free to continue to explore ACS before continuing to review the pipeline. Understanding security checks and tool capabilities are a key part of this lab and can help raise the knowledge of a secure software delivery pipeline.

. The *Image Check* step of the pipeline
+
[Note] The build-time violations of the different security policies defined in ACS.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops39.png[400,700]
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops40.png[400,700]
+
  This step checks build-time and deploy-time violations of security policies defined in ACS for any deployment that uses this image. Due to security policy violations, this pipeline fails at this task because we set security policy enforcement in ACS.
Scanning images is critical to prevent highly vulnerable containerized applications from deployment.
+
. *Deploy-check* shows the violation of the policies in the log. The log shows the violations, but it did not fail at this task because the deployment enforcement is not on in this example. We will explore more on the policy in the later lab.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops41.png[400,700]
+
[Note] These 3 steps (*deploy-check, image-check, and image-scan*) are executed in parallel to save time in our DevSecOps pipeline.
+
. If *image-check* fails, go to the pipeline run and click `image-check`. The bottom of the log shows `Error: Violated a policy with CI enforcement set.` The reason for the error is because ACS enforces the policy from building and deploying if a violation occurs. The pipeline integrates ACS via the roxctl in the Tekton task.
. When an image violates the policies, the best practice is to fix the code and execute the pipeline until it passes the checks. The logs reported the list of violations and remediation. Developers can take the information from the `image-check` task’s log and make changes accordingly. When the fix is checked into Git, the pipeline will be triggered. We have prepared the xref:fiximage[bonus exercise for fixing the image]. If we would like to continue to test other tasks on the pipeline, we can add an exception to the policy to exclude the spring-petclinic.
Adding an exception to a policy can be useful when developers need to fix the code, and the CI process needs to continue the testing.
+
[Note] Please be aware that fixing the code to pass the violation will be the recommended approach.
+
Assuming that we will want to add an exception to bypass the policy for spring-petclinic build.
+
.. When we inspect the log from the *image-check* task, we will find the below message which caused the failure:
+
|===
|✗ Image image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/ocp-workshop/spring-petclinic@sha256:ece54d2923654c36f4e97bc0410f5c027871c5b7483e977cfc6c2bd56fef625d failed policy '*Fixable Severity at least Important*' *(policy enforcement caused failure)*
|===
+
.. Click `waffle icon` image:images/lab4-devsecops42.png[20,20] to get the console links → select `Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security For Kubernetes` as shown below.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops43.png[700,300]
+
.. We will be prompted to log in to the ACS console → click `Advanced` → Click the `Proceed to central-stackrox.apps.cluster...` link to proceed.
.. Enter the following information:
+
|===
|User: admin
|Pass: stackrox
|===
+
.. Click login, and see the ACS dashboard screen as shown below.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops44.png[300,700]
+
.. Click on the top left hamburger  → click Platform Configuration → select System Policies under the Platform Configuration tab.

image:images/lab4-devsecops45.png[120,220]
+
+
.. Under System Policies, select selection named "4 policy scope"

image:images/lab4-devsecops46.png[180,220]

.. at the filter bar, first select policy then type the policy name *Fixable Severity at least Important* in the search field and hit enter. The policy will list as the result.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops47.png[300,700]
+
.. Click on the policy to get to the policy details page. The Policy page allows cloning, exporting, and editing the policy. If it is available, it shows the remediation, so the developer can use the information to fix the image. The lifecycle stage information is where the policy enforcement takes place. Since the enabled policy is violated, it will not pass the build and deploy stages in the pipeline.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops48.png[300,700]
+
.. Let’s edit the policy by clicking image:images/lab4-devsecops50.png[10,10]
.. We want to add an exception in this policy only for spring-petclinic build.
.. Scroll down to `Excluded Images (Build Lifecycle only)``
.. Type:
+
|===
|image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/ocp-workshop/spring-petclinic
|===
+
.. Click onto the “Create “image...”
+
[Note] Please scroll to the bottom of the list to find “Create …”
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops49.png[300,400]
+
.. Click the image:images/lab4-devsecops50.png[50,50] icon 3 times.
+
This step can be helpful when the development team wants to continue to test the pipeline. It is not recommended to disable the policy. Adding exceptions to the policy is a better approach. It is best to update the application and enforce the policy to gate the CI process.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops51.png[200,300]
+
.. Please review the enforcement behavior before clicking in 'save' icon the following screen.
.. Switch back to the OpenShift developer console, and click pipeline on the nav under “ocp-workshop” project
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops52.png[300,700]
+
.. Rerun the pipeline
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops53.png[300,700]
+
.. Click onto the Pipeline Runs tab and click on the Pipeline Run we started
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops54.png[300,700]
+
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops55.png[300,700]
+
.. If we finish the xref:fiximage[bonus lab] to fix the image, go back to the policy and remove the exception in the Policy.
.. Kubernetes kustomization files are updated in the *update deployment step* with the latest image [commit-sha] in the overlays for dev. This will ensure that our applications are deployed using the specific built image in this pipeline.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops56.png[300,700]


=== Lab 4.3 Continuous Delivery Using GitOps

GitOps is a declarative way to implement continuous deployment for cloud-native applications. We can use GitOps to create repeatable processes for managing OpenShift Container Platform clusters and applications across multi-cluster Kubernetes environments. GitOps handles and automates complex deployments at a fast pace, saving time during deployment and release cycles. +
The GitOps workflow pushes an application through development, testing, staging, and production. GitOps either deploys a new application or updates an existing one, so we only need to update the repository; GitOps automates everything else.

Argo CD continuously monitors the configurations stored in the Git repository and uses Kustomize to overlay environment-specific configurations when deploying the application to DEV and STAGE environments.

image:images/lab4-devsecops57.png[300,700]

. The ArgoCD application syncs the manifests in our Gogs git repositories, and applies the changes automatically into the namespaces defined:
.. Click on the waffle icon on the top to get to the console links and select “Cluster Argo CD”
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops43.png[300,300]
+
.. The link redirects to the Argo CD login. If it is the first time logging in to Argo CD, please click `Advanced` → `Proceed to openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.apps…` link.
.. In order to be able to log in as an "admin" user, please first retrieve its password by running the command as shown below.
+
[source]
----
oc get secret/openshift-gitops-cluster -n openshift-gitops -o jsonpath='{.data.admin\.password}' | base64 -d
----
+
.. Once logged in, the applications are listed on the Argo CD console as shown below.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops58.png[500,600]
+
.. Click onto `dev-spring-petclinic` to access the application.
. ArgoCD will deploy every manifest that is defined in the branch/repo of our application. The application shows “Synced”.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops59.png[300,700]
+
.. Click image:images/lab4-devsecops101.png[90,70] to view the details of the `dev-spring-petclinic` application.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops102.png[900,700]

+
.. Go back to the Argo CD console. Click `Applications` on the top left.
+
[Note] The namespace for `stage-spring-petclinic` is set to devsecops-qa.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops62.png[300,300]
+
.. Click `stage-spring-petclinic`
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops63.png[300,700]
+
.. Click image:images/lab4-devsecops64.png[30,40] on the top menu to deploy the application to devsecops-qa and wait until “Synced” as shown below.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops65.png[300,700]
+
.. Back to the OpenShift Dev console, click `Topology` on the left navigation menu under devsecops-qa project. Click the arrow to access the application URL.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops66.png[300,300]
+
.. The application is now deployed to the devsecops-qa project as shown below.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops67.png[300,500]

=== Lab 4.4 PostCI - Dynamic Application Security and Testing (DAST)

*Dynamic application security testing (DAST)* is designed to detect conditions indicative of a security vulnerability in an application in its running state. DAST has an important role in helping to identify vulnerabilities in an application during production. Running a DAST penetration test enables us to find those vulnerabilities before an attacker does.
In this lab, ZAP is used to perform application security testing as an example. Performance tests and penetration tests start in parallel after the application is promoted from Dev to QA.

. Our CI in Openshift Pipelines waits until the ArgoCD app is fully synced (*Wait Application step*) and our app and all the resources are deployed
.. Go to the successful pipeline run, and go to the step *wait-application*
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops68.png[300,700]
+
.. Click onto the step, the log is shown below.
+
This step authenticates into an ArgoCD instance and initiates the synchronization process for 'dev-spring-petclinic' application from Git repo (gogs) to the target project in the OCP cluster.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops69.png[300,700]
+
. Click on the pipeline the step *perf-test-clone*

=== Lab 4.5 Security Policies and CI Violations

In this demo, we can control the security policies applied to our pipelines, scan the images, and analyze the different deployment templates used to deploy our applications. +
We can enforce the different Security Policies in ACS, failing our CI pipelines if a violation of this policy appears in each step of our DevSecOps pipelines (steps “image-check”, “image-scan”, “deploy-check”).

* Click on the `waffle icon` and select `Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes`
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops43.png[300,300]
+
* Log in using credential admin/stackrox to ACS console.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops82.png[300,700]
+
* Click Platform Configuration → System Policies
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops83.png[200,200]
+
Security Policies can be defined at the BUILD level (during the build/push of the image), or at the DEPLOYMENT level (preventing the deployment of the application).
* Click on the Package manager policy
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops84.png[300,700]
+
For example, this Security Policy checks if an RH Package Manager (dnf, yum) is in the application Image and will FAIL the pipeline if it detects that the image built contains any RH Package Manager.
* Click image:images/lab4-devsecops86.png[40,40] for editing the policy on the top left
* The policy details can be modified. Also, the lifecycle stages are defined by the policy and other properties. The enablement of the Policy option is where the user controls the CI to fail or pass.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops85.png[500,500]
+
* Click image:images/lab4-devsecops86.png[40,40] to review all the details before hitting `save`
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops87.png[300,300]
+
This step ensures that users  have total control of the pipelines. No image is pushed into the image registry or is deployed to the cluster that surpasses the defined Security Policies.

=== Bonus suggestion for Lab 4.2: Fixing the image

To show a complete demo and show the transition from a `bad image` to an image that passes the build enforcement, we can update the Tekton task of the image build and fix the image.
In this example, we will be enabling the enforcement of the `Red Hat Package Manager in Image` policy in ACS, which will fail our pipeline at the image-check as both yum and rpm package managers are present in our base image.

. Add an exception to bypass the violation in the *Fixable Severity at least important* policy as we did in the previous section.
. Enable enforcement of the *Red Hat Package Manager in Image* policy:
.. Go to Platform Configuration → System Policies
.. Search for *Red Hat Package Manager in Image* policy
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops88.png[300,400]
+
.. Click onto the `*Red Hat Package Manager in Image*` policy
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops89.png[300,600]
+
.. Click "Next" until reaching the enforcement tab
.. Enable the build time enforcement and save
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops90.png[300,300]
+
.. Go to the OpenShift Dev UI, click Pipelines on the left → click `petclinic-build-dev` pipeline → click Actions on the top right corner → select `Start last run`
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops91.png[300,700]
+
.. Check and confirm that it fails on the *image-check* step as the image has the "rpm" and "yum" package managers installed. Notice the suggestion from the *image-check* step:
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops92.png[400,500]
+
.. We will effectively update the image with this remediation suggestion.
. Update the tekton task:
. Delete the s2i-java-11 task
.. From the OpenShift Administrator UI, make sure the ocp-workshop project is selected before going to Pipelines > Tasks and delete the s2i-java-11 task.
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops93.png[300,700]
+
.. With the Tekton cli tkn task delete s2i-java-11
. Apply the new update task from the command terminal:
+
|===
|kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatDemos/SecurityDemos/master/2021Labs/OpenShiftSecurity/documentation/labs-artifacts/s2ijava-mgr.yaml --namespace=ocp-workshop

|===
+
. Re-run the pipeline, the deployment now succeeds. Congratulations to the developers!
+
[Note] Please check the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatDemos/SecurityDemos/master/2021Labs/OpenShiftSecurity/documentation/labs-artifacts/s2ijava-mgr.yaml[*labs-artifacts/s2ijava-mgr.yaml]*** **file for more details on how the image was fixed. We have added a step to the build task, and we leverage buildah to remove the package managers from the image (search for "rpm" or "yum" in the file).
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops94.png[300,700]

=== Bonus exercise: Temporarily Snoozing CVEs

If we just want to snooze a particular CVEs instead of fixing the image and adding an exception to the policy for the build. ACS allows users to temporarily disable the CVEs for a period of time.

[Note] Snoozing the CVEs will temporarily disable the CVEs for all policies.

For this lab, we can snooze the CVEs that cause the image-check to fail and continue to build the pipeline. We will see the image-check task is reporting the violations information from the log.


image:images/lab4-devsecops95.png[300,700]

In some situations, we may want to snooze the CVEs for a period of time. Here are the steps:

. Go to the ACS console via the `waffle icon` and click on the `Red Hat Advanced Clustered Security for Kubernetes` link.
Click Vulnerability Management left menu and click on the CVEs button  on the top.
. We can look for the CVEs to snooze and set up snooze by selecting the duration is needed.
+

=== Bonus exercise: Notification

ACS can be integrated with several Notifiers for alerting if certain events happen in the clusters managed. In our case, we integrated with Slack to receive notifications when some Policies are violated to have more useful information:

image:images/lab4-devsecops97.png[300,500]

These policy notifications can be enabled by each system policy enabled in our system, so we can create our own notification baseline in order to have only the proper information received in our systems. +
Here are the steps to set up slack integration with ACS based on the official https://help.stackrox.com/docs/integrate-with-other-tools/integrate-with-slack/[Integrate with Slack] documentation in Stackrox.

. Create a Slack App, enable Incoming Webhooks and get the Webhook URL
. Configure the Stackrox Kubernetes Security Platform
+
image:images/lab4-devsecops98.png[300,500]
+
. Enable the Notifications in the system policies: Platform Configuration -> System Policies -> Select Policy -> Actions -> Enable Slack Notifications
+
